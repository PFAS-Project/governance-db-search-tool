  Legislative: The action must be a bill or resolution introduced by a state
  legislature or Congress. This category includes both legislation that is
  successful (passed or enacted) and legislation that is introduced but not
  passed or enacted. Regulatory: The action involves binding policy developed
  within government agencies or offices, requiring an agency, industry, or
  individual to act in a specific way to carry out a policy directive.
  Non-regulatory: The action involves a non-binding policy developed within
  government agencies or offices that does not require an agency, industry, or
  individual to act in a specific way. Instead, a non-regulatory action may
  provide guidance, recommendations, or guidelines on a subject. A
  non-regulatory action is not legally enforceable. Peri-governmental: The
  action does not originate from within any part of the government. These
  actions affect governance in less direct but still important ways. Examples
  include standards set by independent organizations that government agencies
  adopt and lawsuits that may affect governance.

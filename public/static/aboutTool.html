  <p><b>How to use this tool:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>
      To <b>search</b> for all governance actions by keyword(s), type the
      keyword(s) into the search bar at the top of the page. This search could
      include, but is not limited to, keywords for different stakeholders,
      topics, and locations. For example, a search for “California water” will
      provide all governance actions that contain the keywords “California” and
      “water”.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      To <b>filter</b> your search by State or Federal Agency, Type of
      Governance Action, Topic(s) of Governance Action, Date, or Legislative
      Outcome, select the dropdown menu from the filter options on the left of
      the page and select the desired search criteria. For example, to only see
      actions that are from “California”, select the dropdown menu for Federal
      Agency or State and select “California”. Multiple filter selections can be
      selected at once. If no filter options are selected, the output will
      contain all actions. The Reset All Filters button will erase all selected
      filters.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      To <b>download</b> the output of an individual governance action, select
      the download icon next to the name of the governance action. This will
      download the information as a TXT file. To download the full list of
      governance actions, select the download icon to the right of the search
      bar. The downloaded list will only contain the governance actions that
      appear after the search and filter has been applied. This will download
      the information as a CSV file.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      To <b>sort</b> the list of governance actions by date, select the Sort by:
      Date button found at the bottom of the advanced filter options on the left
      of the page. Select the desired category to sort by. If the Sort by: Date
      is not selected, the default sorting will show the federal-level
      governance actions first (alphabetized by federal agency), followed by the
      state-level governance action (alphabetized by state).

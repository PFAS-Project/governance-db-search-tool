  <p><b>How to use this tool:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        To <b>search</b> for all governance actions by keyword(s), type the
        keyword(s) into the search bar at the top of the page. This search could
        include, but is not limited to, keywords for different stakeholders,
        topics, and locations. For example, a search for “California water” will
        provide all governance actions that contain the keywords “California”
        and “water”.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To <b>filter</b> your search by State or Federal Agency, Type of
        Governance Action, Topic(s) of Governance Action, Date, or Legislative
        Outcome, select the dropdown menu from the filter options on the left of
        the page and select the desired search criteria. For example, to only
        see actions that are from “California”, select the dropdown menu for
        Federal Agency or State and select “California”. Multiple filter
        selections can be selected at once. If no filter options are selected,
        the output will contain all actions. The Reset All Filters button will
        erase all selected filters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To <b>sort</b> the list of governance actions by date, select the Sort
        by: Date button found at the bottom of the advanced filter options on
        the left of the page. Select the desired category to sort by. If the
        Sort by: Date is not selected, the default sorting will show the
        federal-level governance actions first (alphabetized by federal agency),
        followed by the state-level governance action (alphabetized by state).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To <b>download</b> the output of an individual governance action, select
        the download icon next to the name of the governance action. This will
        download the information as a TXT file. To download the full list of
        governance actions, select the download icon to the right of the search
        bar. The downloaded list will only contain the governance actions that
        appear after the search and filter has been applied. This will download
        the information as a CSV file.

        The PFAS Project Lab began maintaining its PFAS Governance Tracker in
        2021 with funding from the
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >National Science Foundation</a
        >. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        To find federal actions, PFAS Project Lab research assistants
        searched through all relevant government agency websites in order to
        find <b>federal</b> actions concerning PFAS. They reviewed websites from
        the EPA, DOD, FDA, CPSC, and Congress.gov. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To find state actions, the
        PFAS Project Lab received information collected by
        <a href="https://www.saferstates.org/" target="_blank">Safer States</a>,
        a network of environmental health organizations, about passed and
        unpassed legislation from 2019-2022, and entered all legislation related
        to PFAS. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Other governance actions were identified via news articles and
        searches of legislation for keywords such as “PFAS.” If the action was
        found through a news article or other secondary source, Lab researchers
        located the primary source as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For all legislative actions, the
        primary source is the state legislative webpage for a bill or
        Congress.gov. Next, the action was categorized using the definitions for
        topics created by the PFAS Project Lab. All relevant information
        (legislative outcomes, major players, summary, etc.) was entered
        manually.
      </p>
      <p> 
        PFAS Project Lab members will continuously track news
        articles, press releases, and other online sources that mention PFAS in
        order to add any new governance actions to the PFAS Governance Tracker.

        The PFAS Governance Tracker is intended to provide
        comprehensive and user-friendly information about regulatory and
        legislative action on PFAS in the United States at the federal level and
        in the 50 U.S. States. While our goal is to maintain this database with
        the most accurate and up-to-date information, this database cannot be
        assumed to be completely exhaustive.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, despite our rigorous
        definitions for topics, policy and governance actions were reviewed and
        entered into the database by over half a dozen different individuals,
        making classification differences likely. If there is information that
        is missing or incorrect, please

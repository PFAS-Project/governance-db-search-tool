  <p>
    To sort the list of governance actions by date, select the Sort by: Date
    button found at the bottom of the advanced filter options on the left of the
    page. Click to toggle between ascending and descending sort order.
  </p>
  <p> 
    If the Sort by: Date is not
    selected or is reset, the default sorting will show the federal-level
    governance actions first (alphabetized by federal agency), followed by the
    state-level governance action (alphabetized by state).

<title>Type of Policy Action</title>
<body>
  <b>Agriculture</b>: The action involves anything related to PFAS and
  agriculture, including farming, ranching, food processing, or the food system.
  <br /><br />
  <b>Air</b>: The action involves air contamination, air emissions, or
  respiratory exposure pathway concerns; includes actions related to
  standards-setting, monitoring, and testing of contaminated air.<br /><br />
  <b>Alternatives assessment</b>: The action involves the assessment of hazards
  of chemicals or industrial processes intended to replace PFAS currently in
  use, typically specific to a product sector or a certain chemical intended to
  be replaced.<br /><br />
  <b>Appropriations-omnibus</b>: The action must address PFAS within a larger
  omnibus or appropriations bill. <i>Note</i>: Policy actions with this label
  tend to follow a more classic omnibus definition (that is, a large
  multi-faceted appropriations bill).<br /><br />
  <b>Chemical ban or substitution</b>: The action involves the elimination or
  replacement of certain chemicals. The ban may be comprehensive or it may only
  specify certain product categories or industry processes.<br /><br />
  <b>Children</b>: The action involves measures related to the health and
  wellbeing of babies or children. It includes actions related to products,
  food, medical monitoring, biomonitoring, schools, and any other measures that
  involve special protection of babies and children.<br /><br />
  <b>Clean-up and disposal</b>: The action related to involves the clean-up,
  disposal, or remediation of PFAS contamination. The action may involve the
  actual clean-up process or standards-setting related to clean-up. The action
  may include language on water treatment, safe storage, incineration,
  landfills, deep well injections, other clean-up/disposal techniques, or
  required research on PFAS remediation.<br /><br />
  <b>Data or research requirement</b>: The action involves rigorous, specific
  research on some aspect of PFAS. This research can be conducted by
  universities, government agencies, industry, or other entities.<br /><br />
  <b>Definition</b>: The action’s main goal is to define a PFAS, the chemical
  class of PFAS, or related terms (for example, “hazardous materials”) for
  regulatory and other purposes. This does not include policy actions that
  contain definitions solely for the purpose of clarifying terms within the
  action.<br /><br />
  <b>Drinking water</b>: The action involves water used for human
  consumption.<br /><br />
  <b>Environmental Justice</b>: The action involves a focus on a just
  distribution of environmental hazards, risks, benefits, and/or protections
  related to PFAS, as well as actions that influence how people and communities
  are able to participate in these decision-making processes. It includes
  actions that address equity based on race, gender, class, living environment,
  occupation, and any other identity categories.<br /><br />
  <b>Firefighting and AFFF</b>: The action involves fluorinated aqueous film
  forming foam (AFFF), firefighters, and/or firefighting equipment, including
  personal protective equipment (PPE) Food packaging: The action involves the
  presence of PFAS within food packaging.<br /><br />
  <b>Funding mechanism</b>: The action involves the appropriation of funds
  specifically related to PFAS, including funding for research, treatment, or
  remediation.<br /><br />
  <b>Groundwater</b>: The action involves water stored under the earth’s
  surface; includes actions related to measurement, treatment, and clean up of
  this water source.<br /><br />
  <b>Hazardous designation</b>: The action involves an agency naming PFAS as a
  hazardous substance.<br /><br />
  <b>Investigative orders</b>: The action involves the requirement that
  information or testing data is collected related to a specified event,
  industry, or other entity (for example, investigative orders that require
  environmental sampling for PFAS in a particular industry sector).<br /><br />
  <b>Litigation</b>: The action involves legal action to reduce, remove, or
  eliminate PFAS within products or industry processes. Litigation most often
  involves major lawsuits (with state or federal actors) surrounding PFAS and
  includes any outcomes or settlements reached. (Note that the PFAS Governance
  Tracker does not include all known litigation related to PFAS in the United
  States.)<br /><br />
  <b>Local or state testing</b>: The action involves testing (or monitoring) of
  the water, soil, leachate, sludge, products, or any other medium contaminated
  by PFAS locally or statewide. The testing can be conducted by any government
  agency, individual, corporation, treatment plant, or other entity.<br /><br />
  <b>Medical</b>: The action involves topics related to medical/health outcomes
  or biomonitoring, including blood testing, health insurance coverage, and/or
  medical monitoring provided to individuals and communities impacted by PFAS
  contamination. The medical topic may also include research on the impacts of
  PFAS on human health.<br /><br />
  <b>Military</b>: The action is related to any branch of the United States
  Armed Forces. It includes actions by any branch related to PFAS research,
  contamination, testing, funding, and clean-up or remediation. These actions
  may include measures related to the health and well-being of service-members,
  veterans, and their families, including biomonitoring, medical monitoring, and
  health insurance coverage. It also includes policies or requirements developed
  by the military that impact the use of PFAS (for example in AFFF).<br /><br />
  <b>Multi-toxics-omnibus</b>: The action must mention issues related to PFAS as
  well as at least one other toxic substance (ex. Lead, arsenic, phthalates).
  <i>Note</i>: This label extends beyond the common legislative label of
  “omnibus” (that is, a large multi-faceted appropriations bill), to include
  policy or governance actions that address PFAS and at least one other toxic
  substance.<br /><br />
  <b>Permitting process</b>: The action involves securing permits for new
  projects, remediation, construction, or the discharge of PFAS via industrial
  wastewater.<br /><br />
  <b>PFAS-omnibus</b>: The action must contain three or more PFAS topics within
  the one policy action. <i>Note</i>: This label extends beyond the common
  legislative label of “omnibus,” (that is, a large multi-faceted appropriations
  bill), to include policy or governance actions that package three or more PFAS
  measures (for example, a bill that restricts PFAS in firefighting PPE, food
  packaging, and sets maximum contaminant levels for drinking water).<br /><br />
  <b>PFAS task force</b>: The action involves a group of individuals that work
  collaboratively to address PFAS by engaging with, developing guidance for, or
  coordinating activities among agencies, industries, and other stakeholders.<br /><br />
  <b>Product ban/restriction</b>: The action involves the ban or restriction of
  the purchasing, manufacturing, selling, and/or distribution of specified types
  of consumer products containing the PFAS specified in the action (for example,
  banning the sale of food packaging containing PFAS).<br /><br />
  <b>Reporting requirement</b>: The action involves requiring individuals,
  agencies, or industries to report their PFAS usage, manufacturing, sale, or
  distribution to a government agency, business, residents, the public, or other
  entity.<br /><br />
  <b>Sludge</b>: The action involves the waste residue from industrial processes
  or sewage treatment plants (also called “biosolids”). This action can involve
  policies and governance related to the application of this waste for
  agricultural purposes.<br /><br />
  <b>Soil or leachate</b>: The action involves the ground, land, or liquid that
  escapes landfills or other solids or the treatment and remediation of these
  areas.<br /><br />
  <b>Standards-setting</b>: The action involves the establishment of standards
  that dictate how much PFAS are allowed in media such as drinking water,
  groundwater, leachate, sludge, and more. This includes the maximum contaminant
  levels (MCLs) for drinking water set forth by the EPA. These standards may be
  regulatory (e.g., enforceable MCLs) or non-regulatory (e.g., non-enforceable
  health advisory levels [HALs]).<br /><br />
  <b>Surface Water</b>: The action involves water that is above ground (rivers,
  lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands, reservoirs, creeks, and oceans). It includes
  actions related to measurement, treatment, and/or clean up of surface water
  sources.<br /><br />
  <b>Wastewater</b>: The action involves wastewater or wastewater treatment.
